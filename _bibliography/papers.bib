	abstract = {The paper aims to address the potential of low-carbon and renewable hydrogen in decarbonizing the European energy system; specifically, reducing emissions by 55\% in 2030 compared to 1990, and targeting net-zero emissions by 2050. The methodology relies on a cost-optimization modelling approach using three models complementarily: a detailed European TIMES-type model (MIRET-EU); an aggregated model for the European energy system, allowing endogenous cost reductions based on technology deployment in a dynamic programming formulation for investment strategies (Integrate Europe); and a dedicated model for assessing hydrogen import options for Europe (HyPE). Two policy-relevant scenarios have been developed: Technology Diversification (TD) and Renewable Push (RP). Both lead to climate neutrality in Europe in 2050 but the RP scenario differs by setting new reinforced targets for renewable technologies in Europe. Results show that hydrogen production would increase sharply in the coming decades, exceeding 30 million tons (Mt) by 2030 and more than 100 Mt by 2050 in both scenarios. Polyvalence of hydrogen in decarbonizing the European energy system for certain hard-to-abate energy uses in transport and industry is also observed. European hydrogen production relies on a diverse mix including both renewable and low-carbon technologies. It is complemented by hydrogen imports from neighboring regions, that represent between 10 and 15\% of total demand in 2050. Access to existing cross-border pipelines is a critical advantage compared to maritime transport. Notably, there are considerable cost reductions due to technology deployment for solar power and hydrogen production by electrolyzers.},

	abstract = {The recent European energy crisis has underscored the need for improvements in the electricity market design, emphasising the necessity for enhanced liquidity, flexibility, and risk-hedging instruments. In addition, the ongoing transformation of power systems with more active participation from the demand-side requires revisions of rates and market designs. As a result, demand response (DR) schemes have started to be deployed over the past ten years in many jurisdictions. The objective of this study is to describe current trends and highlight key differences in DR programs to understand whether the most recent programs have achieved their primary objective of integrating consumers in electricity markets and whether DR has been effective in limiting the recent power crises in Europe. A comparative analysis of demand response (DR) programs is performed in different electricity markets: France, Germany, and the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) Interconnection in the United States. Despite the acknowledged critical role of demand response in the future, a global approach to its integration in electricity markets is still lacking. This jeopardises the full potential of demand-side flexibility and prevents benefits for consumers and the grid. However, recent DR programs have also demonstrated their effectiveness during the 2021–2023 energy crisis, notably in France, despite the long-lasting operational and economic challenges. These findings underscore the importance of further research and policy development in this area.},

	abstract = {The adoption of time-varying pricing in the French electricity market has been historically low despite their availability to consumers well before the deployment of smart metering. However, as the share of variable renewable electricity increases and carbon prices grow, the demand-side response will become increasingly important to achieve efficiency gains. Relying on the historical hourly consumption of French electricity consumers and multiple prospective weather years, we study the gain allowed by the broader adoption of time-varying electricity retail rates in low-carbon power systems. We develop a four-stage methodology to assess the efficiency and stability of the electricity supply cost component of the electricity bill in France for historical and prospective years. Our analysis demonstrates that peak pricing schemes have increasing interest in the context of further deployment of renewable capacity, capturing 25\% to 50\% of the welfare gain reached by real-time pricing schemes. The corresponding deadweight loss of peak pricing schemes represents 0.4 to 1 bn EUR per year in 2030 compared to real-time prices (RTP) schemes. Conversely, deadweight loss of current time-of-use (ToU) rates represents 1 to 1.2 bn EUR per year in 2025 and increases over time. The current design of TOU rates does not provide adequate incentives in future power systems. Besides the tariff efficiency, the results underlined an increasing price difference between on-peak and off-peak rates. This questions the social acceptance of time-varying retail rates for consumers unable to hedge against peak prices. By analysing the effectiveness and limitations of time-varying rates, our findings underline the importance and value of price-based DR in future power systems in general. Our results highlight the need to revise the end-user tariff design in the French power system, notably with regard to the conveyed price signals.},

	abstract = {The decarbonisation of heavy-duty road transport is subject to many uncertainties regarding fuel choices and the role of efficiency and demand-side measures. Moreover, the various segments of heavy-duty road transport exhibit distinctive characteristics, posing challenges in identifying a one-size-fits-all solution. In a scenario-based analysis with coupled modelling of the European energy system and its endogenous transport demand (driver training, improved logistics and collective mobility) we study the decarbonisation of European heavy-duty road transport through 2050, with a granular representation of its segments in the modelling exercise. Our modelling results show that battery electric vehicles are the key enablers of climate neutrality, representing 60 \%–89 \% of trucks and 79 \%–96 \% of buses by 2050. Yet, this important level of electrification, in a climate-neutral Europe, represent at most 4 \% (320 TWh) of final electricity consumption. While shifting to electric and hydrogen vehicles brings significant fuel savings (41 \%–66 \%) and emission reductions (33 \%–60 \% cumulatively), demand-side operational measures can quickly and cost-effectively complement fuel switching, bringing up to 50 \% of cumulative emission savings. The modelling results are highly sensitive to policy assumptions, especially regarding those related to the role of clean hydrogen. This calls for long-term planning with stable and clear signalling of technology choices.},

	title = {Economic considerations on the demand-side of electricity markets in a context of energy transition},
	url = {https://pastel.hal.science/tel-04521115},
	abstract = {This thesis complements the existing literature on electricity market design and decarbonised power systems by focusing on three major issues: (i) understanding to what extent the existing electricity market designs have fostered demand-side flexibility, (ii) analysing the preferred price signals to be conveyed towards consumers in the evolving electricity markets and (iii) assessing the welfare loss due to imperfect information and pace asymmetry between the supply and the demand in a context of accelerated electrification. The main results are outlined below.First, electricity markets entail different geographical and temporal realities depending on the sub-market considered. Demand-side integration could improve the economic efficiency of the power system by reducing investments in peak power plants or grid reinforcement and providing additional flexibility to accommodate variable renewable energy sources. However, depending on the specific objectives pursued, different market designs must be settled and deployed. The case of France, Germany and Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland shows that none of the current programs has successfully established a steady framework for integrating demand-side in electricity markets. This lag in adoption contrasts with the significant potential capacity and value found in the literature and the numerous empirical evidence underlining the price elasticity of consumers. Eventually, existing programs only partially provide the conditions necessary for managing prolonged power crisis episodes or accommodating the intra-day variability of variable renewable energy sources (vRES).Second, existing dynamic tariffs in France are no longer expected to provide adequate price signals in decarbonising electricity markets. In a situation where renewables production determines price patterns, fixed schedules will no longer be the most relevant tariff design compared to more flexible dynamic pricing. Conversely, peak pricing performs well in reducing deadweight loss by signalling scarcity episodes. While an increasing gap between on-peak and off-peak power prices increases the strength of price signals conveyed to consumers, it might negatively impact the adoption rate of consumers if those are not provided with sufficient flexibility or hedging possibilities.Third, the industrial electrification pace requires proper anticipation of forward power prices to ensure timely supply-side decarbonisation through electrification. An accelerated electrification scenario that would not factor in the achievable pace of power generation increase would lead to welfare losses. While electrification strategies shift the emissions burden from the downstream sector towards the power production, adverse effects could arise if investments are uncoordinated, leading to potential power price surges or increased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the power sector. Policymakers should also consider the appropriate pace of carbon price increase while monitoring its effectiveness. Indeed, while carbon pricing provides effective decarbonisation incentives, excessively accelerated trajectories would likely lead to welfare losses if industries are unable to follow a similar rate of deployment of abatement technologies},

	abstract = {This paper examines the conditions and importance of electrification in the decarbonisation of the hard-to-abate sector in Central-West Europe. We analyse energy transition pathways until 2050 for the power sector and consider the case of the chemical sector, using a novel co-optimisation model, minimising the net present cost of both sectors. We consider different carbon price trajectories, with sensitivities performed on the availability of carbon capture and storage technologies. We find that the electrification of energy used by the industry is among the key levers toward abating CO

 emissions. This could lead to a two-fold increase in its electricity consumption by 2050 which in turn would have considerable impacts on the type and pace of investments required in the power sector. Additionally, not considering the impact of electrification on the growth of power demand leads to overestimated GHG reduction potential in the interim period 2025-2040 and results in a significant underestimation of electricity demand. Finally, the availability of carbon capture and storage might result in increased electricity consumption by providing more affordable electricity to downstream sectors. These results call for considering the likely investment realised in the upstream power sector when assessing preferred pathways for GHGs reduction in downstream sectors such as energy-intensive industries. Likewise, considering different carbon price trajectories would result in significantly different power demand trajectories in the chemical sector ranging from a reduction of 13\% to an increase of 280\% on the electricity consumption of the chemical sector, with non-negligible impacts on investments in the power sector},
