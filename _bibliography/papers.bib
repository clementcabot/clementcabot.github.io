	abstract = {The paper aims to address the potential of low-carbon and renewable hydrogen in decarbonizing the European energy system; specifically, reducing emissions by 55\% in 2030 compared to 1990, and targeting net-zero emissions by 2050. The methodology relies on a cost-optimization modelling approach using three models complementarily: a detailed European TIMES-type model (MIRET-EU); an aggregated model for the European energy system, allowing endogenous cost reductions based on technology deployment in a dynamic programming formulation for investment strategies (Integrate Europe); and a dedicated model for assessing hydrogen import options for Europe (HyPE). Two policy-relevant scenarios have been developed: Technology Diversification (TD) and Renewable Push (RP). Both lead to climate neutrality in Europe in 2050 but the RP scenario differs by setting new reinforced targets for renewable technologies in Europe. Results show that hydrogen production would increase sharply in the coming decades, exceeding 30 million tons (Mt) by 2030 and more than 100 Mt by 2050 in both scenarios. Polyvalence of hydrogen in decarbonizing the European energy system for certain hard-to-abate energy uses in transport and industry is also observed. European hydrogen production relies on a diverse mix including both renewable and low-carbon technologies. It is complemented by hydrogen imports from neighboring regions, that represent between 10 and 15\% of total demand in 2050. Access to existing cross-border pipelines is a critical advantage compared to maritime transport. Notably, there are considerable cost reductions due to technology deployment for solar power and hydrogen production by electrolyzers.},

	abstract = {The recent European energy crisis has underscored the need for improvements in the electricity market design, emphasising the necessity for enhanced liquidity, flexibility, and risk-hedging instruments. In addition, the ongoing transformation of power systems with more active participation from the demand-side requires revisions of rates and market designs. As a result, demand response (DR) schemes have started to be deployed over the past ten years in many jurisdictions. The objective of this study is to describe current trends and highlight key differences in DR programs to understand whether the most recent programs have achieved their primary objective of integrating consumers in electricity markets and whether DR has been effective in limiting the recent power crises in Europe. A comparative analysis of demand response (DR) programs is performed in different electricity markets: France, Germany, and the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) Interconnection in the United States. Despite the acknowledged critical role of demand response in the future, a global approach to its integration in electricity markets is still lacking. This jeopardises the full potential of demand-side flexibility and prevents benefits for consumers and the grid. However, recent DR programs have also demonstrated their effectiveness during the 2021–2023 energy crisis, notably in France, despite the long-lasting operational and economic challenges. These findings underscore the importance of further research and policy development in this area.},

	abstract = {The adoption of time-varying pricing in the French electricity market has been historically low despite their availability to consumers well before the deployment of smart metering. However, as the share of variable renewable electricity increases and carbon prices grow, the demand-side response will become increasingly important to achieve efficiency gains. Relying on the historical hourly consumption of French electricity consumers and multiple prospective weather years, we study the gain allowed by the broader adoption of time-varying electricity retail rates in low-carbon power systems. We develop a four-stage methodology to assess the efficiency and stability of the electricity supply cost component of the electricity bill in France for historical and prospective years. Our analysis demonstrates that peak pricing schemes have increasing interest in the context of further deployment of renewable capacity, capturing 25\% to 50\% of the welfare gain reached by real-time pricing schemes. The corresponding deadweight loss of peak pricing schemes represents 0.4 to 1 bn EUR per year in 2030 compared to real-time prices (RTP) schemes. Conversely, deadweight loss of current time-of-use (ToU) rates represents 1 to 1.2 bn EUR per year in 2025 and increases over time. The current design of TOU rates does not provide adequate incentives in future power systems. Besides the tariff efficiency, the results underlined an increasing price difference between on-peak and off-peak rates. This questions the social acceptance of time-varying retail rates for consumers unable to hedge against peak prices. By analysing the effectiveness and limitations of time-varying rates, our findings underline the importance and value of price-based DR in future power systems in general. Our results highlight the need to revise the end-user tariff design in the French power system, notably with regard to the conveyed price signals.},

	abstract = {The decarbonisation of heavy-duty road transport is subject to many uncertainties regarding fuel choices and the role of efficiency and demand-side measures. Moreover, the various segments of heavy-duty road transport exhibit distinctive characteristics, posing challenges in identifying a one-size-fits-all solution. In a scenario-based analysis with coupled modelling of the European energy system and its endogenous transport demand (driver training, improved logistics and collective mobility) we study the decarbonisation of European heavy-duty road transport through 2050, with a granular representation of its segments in the modelling exercise. Our modelling results show that battery electric vehicles are the key enablers of climate neutrality, representing 60 \%–89 \% of trucks and 79 \%–96 \% of buses by 2050. Yet, this important level of electrification, in a climate-neutral Europe, represent at most 4 \% (320 TWh) of final electricity consumption. While shifting to electric and hydrogen vehicles brings significant fuel savings (41 \%–66 \%) and emission reductions (33 \%–60 \% cumulatively), demand-side operational measures can quickly and cost-effectively complement fuel switching, bringing up to 50 \% of cumulative emission savings. The modelling results are highly sensitive to policy assumptions, especially regarding those related to the role of clean hydrogen. This calls for long-term planning with stable and clear signalling of technology choices.},
